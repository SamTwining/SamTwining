ðŸ‘‹ I'm Sam Twining

I use my public GitHub like a glorified stash, and most of my active projects are private! A better representation of my experience is available on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samtwining/). Since my GitHub profile doesn't make for a great link so let me show you what I've been up to recently.

# Kintsugi Technology
I co-run a [consulting business](https://kintsugitechnology.com) helping businesses deliver their products (faster|better|on time) according to their needs. We started in mid-2022, but have already helped ship 4 separate projects alongside process and development management.  

Some of the help we've provided includes:  
- Developing designs into WYSIWYG components in Wordpress using Elementor
- Implementing agile practices to ensure goals are met and requirements are fully fleshed out
- Hotfixing and implementing functionality for Shopify sites and applications
- Hardening applications under attack and in need of security standards
- Migrating applications to a different host including cloud migration
- On-call services for emergent needs

# Side Projects

## Elementor Scaffolding
Elementor has been a popular component ecosystem for Wordpress based sites that I've worked on. As with any framework, I found myself facing the pain points and began writing a small utility library to help navigate them.  

Internally I used a series of scripts that help generate templating, component inputs, and implementing the best practices I've found online and discovered myself through my work.

## Game Development
Learning a programming language is difficult when you're not exposed to real life problems. One of my favorite ways to increase my depth of knowledge with a language is to write a small game. I find it's a great way to explore a language's limitations and strengths as you need to sort out larger concepts like  deferred actions, and structuring and isolating complex systems, down to smaller things like logging, toolchain management, and deployment.  

A lot of them fizzle once I've gotten my worth out of them, but most recently I've been working on a simple [Vampire Survivors](https://poncle.itch.io/vampire-survivors) clone in Typescript, using Vite, Photon, PixiJS, Electron and Colyseus.js.
